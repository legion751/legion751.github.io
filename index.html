  <body>
    <p>State 751 state rules<br>
      1.&nbsp; This state is a NO NAP STATE!!<br>
      2. No tile hitting unless they are gathering inside your alliance
      hive.(Tiles are the Wood,Food,Metal and Gas farms). <br>
      Hive is defined as: Near the Alliance HQ and max 50 radius around the HQ.<br>
      3. No zeroing of player bases, this means killing all of their troops.<br>
      4. Do not attack any alliance HQ unless you can proof the alliance is
      inactive.<br>
      5. Do not cover more than 50% of a center/bunker or facility so that
      others have access to the buildings. Also do not Demolish any alliance
      buildings unless they restrict your access to these buildings.<br>
      6. During bunker, analysis center, capital fight, horde, trap, or
      reservoir raid the player settlements that are busy with these events are
      off limit. Meaning they should not be attacked nor should they attack or
      recon others during these events. This keeps the fights and events fair
      for everyone.<br>
      7. Before SVS(State versus State event)there is a state wide NAP for the
      duration of: 5 days.<br>
      8. If state rules are broken you have to first contact the offending
      alliance R5/Diplomat and try to work out a solution. This has to be done
      BEFORE posting a complaint in #violation-reports.<br>
